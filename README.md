# Binary-Classification-Problem-2020

This is the same binary classification problem that I've solved in 2019 here:
https://github.com/zoz144/Task-2-Binary-Classification-Problem

What have changed this year?
- More detials in data assessing and cleaning
- Increasing the accuracy from 69% to ~88%

*Note:
- I've implemented basic microservice to handle and serve predictions, I wanted to make it by flask but I was careful to submit in deadline.
- The last update for the notebook was in 10/8/2020
